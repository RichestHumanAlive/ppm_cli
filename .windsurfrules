# Panoramic Package Manager (PPM)

## **Purpose of PPM**

The Panoramic Package Manager (PPM) is a platform-agnostic CLI tool designed to unify the workflows of multiple package managers such as `npm`, `pip`, `scoop`, and `winget`. The tool should streamline common tasks like installing, updating, searching, and managing dependencies across different ecosystems with a user-friendly and consistent interface. The primary target audience is developers who work across various operating systems and need an efficient solution to manage packages seamlessly.

## **Key Principles**

1. **Unified Experience**:
   - The CLI should provide a standardized set of commands (e.g., `install`, `update`, `remove`, `search`) regardless of the underlying package manager.
   - Automatically detect the appropriate package manager to use based on the package or system environment.

2. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - Must run seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - Handle OS-specific package managers (e.g., `winget` for Windows, `brew` for macOS).

3. **Modular and Scalable Design**:
   - Use a plugin-like architecture to easily add or update support for new package managers.
   - Ensure maintainability with clear separation of concerns (e.g., CLI, package manager logic, configuration).

4. **User-Centric Features**:
   - Prioritize user convenience with advanced features like environment replication, parallel operations, and enhanced search capabilities.
   - Use interactive UI elements provided by the **Gum** library for better feedback and interactivity.

## **Core Features**

1. **Unified Commands**:
   - `install [package]`: Install a package using the detected package manager.
   - `update [package/all]`: Update a specific package or all packages.
   - `search [package]`: Search for a package across supported package managers.

2. **Advanced Search**:
   - Query all integrated package managers simultaneously for a package.
   - Display results with package details (name, version, description, etc.).

3. **Environment Export/Import**:
   - Export installed packages to a configuration file (e.g., `ppm-env.yaml`).
   - Recreate the environment on a new machine using the configuration file.

4. **Multi-Manager Updates**:
   - A single command to update all packages across all integrated managers.

5. **Dependency Conflict Resolution**:
   - Detect and resolve conflicts between globally installed packages (e.g., Python vs. Node.js dependencies).

6. **Parallel Operations**:
   - Enable concurrent installation or updates to save time.

7. **Offline Mode**:
   - Cache package metadata and installers for offline operations.

8. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Pre/post-installation hooks for custom tasks like configuration setup.

## **Libraries and Tools**

- **Cobra**: For building the CLI commands and subcommands.
- **Gum**: For enhanced user interaction with spinners, progress bars, and prompts.
    Make sure you use gum for UI everywhere it is possible, we will define our UI components module built on top of gum and will call those component every single time they can substitute standard cli Ui components
- **Native Go Libraries**: For handling OS-level operations and subprocess management.

## **Guidelines for Development**

1. **Coding Standards**:
   - Use idiomatic Go conventions.
   - Ensure modularity with clear and reusable components.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Provide clear error messages when operations fail (e.g., network issues, missing package manager).
   - Gracefully handle unsupported package managers or OS-specific limitations.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use concurrency for operations that interact with multiple package managers or repositories.
   - Minimize latency during search and install operations.

4. **Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for individual commands and operations.
   - Perform integration tests across different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - Test edge cases like dependency conflicts, network failures, and incomplete installations.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Provide detailed documentation for users (e.g., `ppm help` command).
   - Include clear contribution guidelines for adding support for new package managers.

## **Future-Proofing**

1. **Plugin Support**:
   - Allow developers to extend PPM with custom plugins for niche package managers.

2. **Cloud Integration**:
   - Enable syncing of environments to cloud platforms like GitHub for team collaboration.

3. **Community Feedback**:
   - Maintain an open roadmap for features based on user feedback.

4. **Version Control**:
   - Implement version locking for packages to ensure consistency across environments.

**Success Criteria**: PPM should be reliable, intuitive, and offer tangible time savings to developers by automating and simplifying multi-package manager workflows. Adherence to the rules outlined here will ensure that the tool meets developer needs effectively.
